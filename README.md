## Local Development

Install Gatsby globally:
`npm install --global gatsby-cli`

To install dependencies, go to the project root and run:

`yarn install`

To start the Gatsby development server:

`yarn develop`

To deploy:

`yarn deploy`

To serve the static build:

`yarn serve`

**Note: _develop_ is the main branch of development. Anything committed to _master_ will be overwritten in the deployment process, since Github pages require that _master_ be used for an organization page.**
