## Local Development

Install Gatsby globally:
`npm install --global gatsby-cli`

To install dependencies, go to the project root and run:

`npm install`

To start the Gatsby development server:

`npm run develop`

To deploy:

`npm run deploy`

To serve the static build:

`npm run serve`

**Note: *develop* is the main branch of development. Anything committed to *master* will be overwritten in the deployment process, since Github pages require that *master* be used for an organization page.** 


Todo:

- update projects copy
- animate landing tile's chevron
- add contact links
